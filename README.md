# Build AI Low-Code Platform — Part 3

This Angular project is part of the **Foblex Flow Tutorial Series**, which shows how to build powerful visual editors and low-code tools using [Foblex Flow](https://flow.foblex.com) — a lightweight and modular open-source library for building node-based interfaces in Angular.
