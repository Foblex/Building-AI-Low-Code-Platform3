# Build AI Low-Code Platform — Part 2

This Angular project is part of the **Foblex Flow Tutorial Series**, which demonstrates how to build visual editors and node-based interfaces using [Foblex Flow](https://flow.foblex.com) — a powerful open-source Angular library for interactive graphs and UI logic modeling.

📘 **Building AI Low-Code Platform in Angular — Part 2: Creating Your First Flow**  
In this part, we create draggable nodes using `FNodeDirective`, connect them with `FNodeOutputDirective` and `FNodeInputDirective`, and render a basic interactive flow using `FFlowComponent`.
